# What is this?

It's an example project that combines Typescript-based source files with a Rollup build system.  We want our bundles to be smaller and more robust with Rollup, but we also want to write our source code in Typescript.

# How to Use

Clone this repository, and using a terminal, run the following in the project root:

`npm install`
`npm run build`

See `package.json` for information about these scripts.
